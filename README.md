# DrawingIA
A project in development based on Python and Django that seeks to create an interactive web application where users can draw on screen and receive a prediction from a neural network trained with TensorFlow or PyTorch. The idea is for the AI ​​to try to recognize what the user has drawn, thus exploring the potential of artificial intelligence in interpreting handwritten strokes.
